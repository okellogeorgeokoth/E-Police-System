# E-Police-System
E-police reporting system is a web-based system that helps the public file a complaint by reporting crimes, report missing persons and as well automate 
the occurrence Book(OB) enabling searching of previous records in the OB, enable the public interact with the police freely helping them find wanted person.
E-police system is a system that gives residents a platform to engage the police and provide sensitive information to the police without physically reporting 
to the police station. This system enhances the privacy of data since users have to authenticate using the log in details before accessing the system. This system
helps to improve the security of the public and police, within the police station and the surroundings by the virtue of privacy of information given to residents. 
Interviews were used to collect data considering it as an effective method for data collection. This system enhances real-time reporting of crimes from the public 
to the police improving on security. This research uses Agile Methodology that is based on developing a system depending on current trends, opportunities and analyzing
the risks to develop a better system. PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and CSS (cascading style sheet) were used for developing the system, CSS was used in this system to change
the appearance of web pages while HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) ensured the pages are created accordingly. Since technology has been improving gradually in Kenya, 
as technology can be observed in various fields almost in every part of our lives. This has enhanced time and effort saving in most of the activities but in the police
department, they still operate manually which is "pen and paper" work. Therefore, this research recommends developing a system that aims at helping the police in
searching wanted persons, store their voluminous data and even help in improving the security of the residents.
